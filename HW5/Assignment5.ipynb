    "      its assigned insurance risk rating, (c) its normalized losses in use\n",

    "      degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates.\n",
    "      Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its\n",
    "      price.   Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is\n",
    "      adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale.  Actuarians call this\n",
